# PostgreSQL Component

PostgreSQL Component is a library that provides a PostgreSQL component for use with the Integrant library.

## Dealing with migrations

This library does not provide any integration with migrations tooling. You should handle the migrations outside the
application. You should use [pg2 migrations tooling](https://github.com/igrishaev/pg2/blob/master/docs/migrations.md) or any other tooling that you prefer.

## Executing tests

To run the tests for this library, you need to have a Docker environment running.

```lein run auto-test``` or ```lein run auto-test-remote ```
